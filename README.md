 1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources (e.g., servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. Resources are dynamically assigned, scaled, and reassigned based on user needs.

---

 2. Origins of Cloud Computing
- Traced back to mainframes in the 1950s.
- Modern cloud computing emerged with virtualization technologies and hypervisors.

---

 3. Cloud Adoption Strategy
Organizations must consider:
- Business needs
- Investment viability
- Risk capacity
- Security, compliance, and performance to ensure a smooth transition to the cloud.

---

 4. Cloud Service Providers
Major providers include:
- AWS
- Alibaba Cloud
- Google Cloud
- IBM Cloud
- Microsoft Azure

---

 5. Benefits of Cloud Adoption
- Agility: Faster innovation and responsiveness.
- Competitiveness: Enables businesses to create differentiated customer experiences.
- Scalability: Resources scale up or down based on demand.

---

 6. Real-World Case Studies
- American Airlines: Delivered customer value rapidly using cloud technologies.
- UBank: Empowered developers to innovate by leveraging cloud platforms.
- Bitly: Used cloud scalability for low-latency delivery to global users.
- ActivTrades: Accelerated execution and delivery of online trading systems.

---

 7. Emerging Technologies on the Cloud
- Internet of Things (IoT): Combating poaching of endangered rhinos in South Africa.
- Artificial Intelligence (AI): Enhancing fan experiences for the United States Tennis Association.
- Blockchain: Building traceability in the food supply chain to reduce waste.
- Data Analytics: Predictive maintenance for city infrastructure by KONE.

---

 8. Cloud Service Models
1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):
   - Delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources.
   - Key Components: Physical data centers, compute, network, storage.
2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):
   - Provides a complete platform (hardware, software, infrastructure).
   - Advantages: Scalability, faster time-to-market, agility.
3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):
   - Offers access to cloud-based software.
   - Characteristics: Multitenant architecture, security, customization, subscription model.
   - Advantages: Direct procurement, improved productivity, cost distribution.

---

 9. Cloud Deployment Models
1. Public Cloud:
   - Owned and managed by service providers.
   - Resources are shared among multiple users.
2. Private Cloud:
   - Exclusive use by a single organization.
   - Can be on-premises or hosted by a provider (e.g., Virtual Private Cloud).
3. Hybrid Cloud:
   - Combines private and public clouds for flexibility.
4. Community Cloud:
   - Shared by organizations with common concerns.

---

 10. Cloud Infrastructure
- Components: Data centers, storage, networking, and computing resources.
- Virtualization: Creation of software-based versions of physical resources using hypervisors.
- Types of Virtual Machines (VMs):
  - Shared/Public Cloud VMs
  - Transient/Spot VMs
  - Reserved VMs
  - Dedicated Hosts
- Bare Metal Servers: Single-tenant physical servers for high-performance computing.

---

 11. Networking in the Cloud
- Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs): Secure deployment of resources into subnets.
- Load Balancers: Distribute traffic for responsive applications.

---

 12. Containers
- Lightweight, executable units of software.
- Package application code, libraries, and dependencies.
- Enable cloud-native applications and streamline development.

---

 13. Cloud Storage Types
1. Direct Attached (Local) Storage: Directly connected to a server.
2. File Storage: Accessed via Network File System (NFS).
3. Block Storage: High-speed fiber connections for volumes.
4. Object Storage: Accessed via API, infinite capacity, slower speeds.

---

 14. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Distributed server network for faster content delivery.
- Caches content based on usersâ€™ geographic locations.

---

 15. Hybrid Multi-Cloud
- Strategy for seamless interoperability between public, private, and on-premises IT.
- Leverages the best services from multiple cloud providers.

---

 16. Microservices Architecture
- Applications built as loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
- Enables efficient development, maintenance, and upgrades.

---

 17. Serverless Computing
- Offloads infrastructure management to cloud providers.
- Allows developers to focus on coding and testing.

---

 18. Cloud-Native Applications
- Built or refactored for the cloud environment.
- Use microservices and containers for quick iterative cycles.

---

 19. DevOps
- Collaborative approach for continuous software delivery.
- Reduces overhead and duplication, enabling faster updates.

---

 20. Application Modernization
- Accelerates digital transformation using cloud technologies.
- Enables organizations to respond to market changes.

---

 21. Cloud Security
- Shared Responsibility: Between cloud providers and users.
- Key Practices:
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - Cloud encryption (at rest, in transit, in use)
  - Continuous monitoring of data exchanges.

---

 22. Real-World Business Benefits
- The Weather Company: Reliable delivery of critical weather data.
- Cementos Pacasmayo: Operational excellence and market expansion.
- Welch: Business value from hybrid cloud storage.
- LiquidPower: Business growth using cloud-based SAP applications.
